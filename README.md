# statistics-functions
A collection of various basic statistics functions written in C. I wrote these to assist me in several projects i've worked on during my studies. All the comments are in spanish.\
\
Some highlights:\
-A shift-register PRNG, that is more suitable for simulation applications than a linear congruential PRNG.\
-A histogram function, to classify data sets into user-defined classes.\
\
TO-DO:\
-Write comments in english.\
-Delete redundant comments.
