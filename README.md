# statistics-functions
A collection of various basic statistics functions written in C. I wrote these to assist me in several projects i've worked on during my studies. They were written in late 2012 when I was still not too experienced, so code quality might not be very good. I'm posting this just in case someone finds it useful as, for instance, a learning resource.\
\
Some highlights:\
-A shift-register PRNG, that is more suitable for simulation applications than a linear congruential PRNG.\
-A histogram function, to classify data sets into user-defined classes.\
\
TO-DO:\
-Write comments in english.\
-Delete redundant comments.
